## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Youtube: 
- Very smooth user interaction, where nothing feels clunky or delayed. 
- Allows for a quick ability to watch, download, and upload videos from the app. 
- Save to watch later, allowing playlists, and nice color scheme for dark mode and light mode. 

Spotify: 
- Spotify's algorithm-driven personalized playlists, such as Discover Weekly and Daily Mixes, cater to individual music preferences
- The option to create and collaborate on playlists with friends fosters a sense of community and shared musical enjoyment.
- The option to share favorite songs, playlists, and even real-time listening activity on social media

Google Maps: 
- Real-Time Navigation: Complete with real time traffic updates and alternative routes. 
- Offline Maps: The ability to download maps for offline use is particularly useful in areas with limited connectivity
- Google Maps excels in providing detailed information about local businesses, including reviews, photos, and operating hours.


App Idea: 

DreamSync is a comprehensive sleep tracking app designed to help users cultivate healthier sleep habits and gain insights into their sleep patterns. The app allows users, especially busy college students like yourself, to log their daily sleep duration, record power naps, and input specific details about their sleep environment, routine and dreams. Users can set personalized sleep goals, and DreamSync will provide tailored recommendations for achieving better sleep based on individual habits.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: Challenges that I encountered while building the app is the user interface of the actual app, because it was overstimulating at first and the syntax was confusing. My Xcode also crashed multiple times but after a while I got the hang of what not to do.
